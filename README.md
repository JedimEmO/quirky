# Quirky WGPU UI library

This is the initial sketch fo a retained mode UI library written for WGPU targets.
It is still highly experimental, and the API is bound to change a lot still.

## Requirements

Rust >= 1.70.0 should be fine

## Running examples


```shell
cargo run --example anchored_buttons --release
```

```shell
cargo run --bin test1 --release
```
